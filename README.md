# Ultimate Automizer VS Code Extension

This extension runs a formal verification on the current active C file. It relies on [Ultimate Automizer](https://github.com/ultimate-pa/ultimate) as external tool.

## Features

After activation of this extension, on each saving of a C file, a formal verification by Ultimate Automizer on the file is performed.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

Docker has to be installed.
